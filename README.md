CS-230-T2591 Operating Platforms 21EW2

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

  The Gaming Room is looking to expand their current Android game, Draw It or Lose It to multiple platforms through a web-based interface.
  
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

  The part of this documentation that I did well was the Executive summary and the design constraints.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

  Understanding the design constraints that the client has is helpful when developing the code because it allows you to plan ahead with what you need to do instead of having to update code you have already developed to follow the constraints.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

  I would revise the Evaluation section to help give a better understanding of each of the operating platforms and their benefits. I would improve it by getting into more research into the pros and cons of each platform to assist with explaining the benefits and how they compare to each other.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

  I interpreted the user’s needs by reading through their goal for the application. I then used this information to write out the design constraints that they had. Using these constraints, I was able to design a piece of software that works within them.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

  My approach in designing the software was to review the design constraints and develop the best solution. I would use the same approach of gathering as many of the needs of the client before starting work on the software.
